# Explanation of E-commerce Web Application Deployment

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Ansible playbook structure and roles used to deploy the e-commerce web application. The project follows best practices for configuration management and DevOps automation.

## Project Structure

The directory structure of the project is organized as follows:

- `playbook.yml`: The main Ansible playbook that orchestrates the deployment process.
- `roles/`: This directory contains the roles used in the playbook.
  - `frontend_role/`: Role responsible for setting up the frontend of the application.
  - `container_role/`: Role for containerization and application deployment.
  - [Other roles]: Additional roles can be added for specific tasks.
- `tasks/`: The `tasks/main.yml` files within each role contain specific tasks related to that role.
- `vars/`: The `vars/main.yml` files within each role define role-specific variables and configurations.
- `templates/`: This directory can be used to store template files used in the roles.

## Roles and Tasks

### Front-end Role

The `frontend_role` handles the setup of the frontend of the e-commerce application. Tasks within this role include:

- Installing Nginx to serve the frontend files.
- Configuring Nginx with a custom configuration template.
- Copying frontend files to the web server directory.
- Ensuring that Nginx is started and enabled.
- Removing the default Nginx welcome page.

### Container Role

The `container_role` is responsible for containerization and application deployment. Specific tasks may include:

- Installing Docker for containerization.
- Building and running Docker containers with the application.
- Configuring the containers, including port mappings and networking.

### Additional Roles

You can create additional roles to handle other aspects of your application, such as database setup, security configurations, or specific application components.

## Configuration Variables

Each role may define its own variables within the `vars/main.yml` file. These variables can be customized to match your deployment requirements. For example, the `docker_image` variable may specify the Docker image to use in the `container_role`.

## Flow of Execution

The playbook executes tasks in the following sequence:

1. Frontend setup tasks from the `frontend_role`.
2. Containerization and application deployment tasks from the `container_role`.
3. Common tasks for Docker installation and code cloning.
4. Testing tasks to verify application functionality.

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting common issues during deployment, refer to the "Troubleshooting" section below:

- Issue: Nginx is not serving the frontend correctly.
  - Solution: Verify Nginx configuration and ensure that frontend files are copied correctly.

- [Other issues and solutions]

## Testing Strategy

The project may include unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests for validating the application's functionality. You can run tests using specific commands, which should be documented in the respective role tasks or the main playbook.
